# Welcome! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile, where you can find all of my projects here.

## I'm currently...

- 🔭 working as full-stack developer, with focus on front-end (and occasionally back-end).
- ⚛️ working on the big project, post(s) incoming!
- 📔 [writing blogs](https://eas.web.id/blog). Go check them out!
- 💻 (slowly) homelabbing, also hosting some small apps to support productivity.

## Fun fact

- 💻 I love tinkering! Computers, gadgets, and all things tech... IoT and 3D printing, anyone?
- 🎶 I love instrumental songs, especially orchestral and epic ones!
